### 🧑‍🔬 Expert Consultation
- **Schedule Consultation** with experts  
- **Download Reports** with detailed recommendations  
- 🌍 **Trend-based Advisory:** Our **AI-powered model** analyzes **past agricultural trends** at **global, national, and state levels** to recommend the most suitable crop for farmers.  
  - Example: *If wheat demand is rising in global markets, but maize is more profitable in a farmer’s state, the system provides a comparative recommendation balancing both opportunities.*

## 💡 Innovative SIH Feature
What sets our platform apart in **Smart India Hackathon 2025**:  

👉 We have developed a **Trend-based Crop Recommendation Model** that:  
- Studies **global, national, and state-level agricultural patterns**  
- Uses **past crop yield & price trends** for accurate forecasting  
- Suggests the **best crop for the farmer’s field** by balancing:  
  - Market demand  
  - Profitability  
  - Suitability to soil & climate  

This ensures that farmers not only grow **what their soil supports**, but also **what the market needs** — maximizing both **productivity and profitability**. 🌾📈
